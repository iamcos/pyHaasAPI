# Market Format Fix Summary

## Issue
The market format in several files was using lowercase with underscores, but the HaasOnline API requires the market format to be in UPPERCASE with underscores.

## Correct Format
The correct market format should be: `{EXCHANGE}_{PRIMARY}_{SECONDARY}_`

Examples:
- `BINANCE_BTC_USDT_`
- `BINANCE_ETH_USDT_`
- `COINBASE_BTC_USD_`

## Files Fixed

### Test Files
- `test_market_data.py` - Fixed market symbol format to use `.upper()`
- `test_order_management.py` - Fixed market symbol format to use `.upper()`

### Example Files
- `examples/simple_test.py` - Fixed market format in both print statement and lab creation
- `examples/mcp_scalper_sweep.py` - Already had correct format
- `examples/randomize_lab_parameters.py` - Already had correct format
- `examples/parameter_handling_example.py` - Needs manual fix (market_tag format)

### Core Files
- `pyHaasAPI/model.py` - The `CloudMarket` class has a `format_market_tag` method that shows the correct format

## Files That Don't Need Changes
Some files use `market.market` which suggests the market object already contains the correctly formatted string:
- `examples/sync_executor.py`
- `examples/update_lab_details.py`
- `examples/create_bot_from_lab.py`
- `pyHaasAPI/lab.py`

## Verification
The correct format can be verified by:
1. Looking at the `CloudMarket.format_market_tag()` method in `model.py`
2. Checking the README.md examples which show `BINANCE_BTC_USDT_`
3. Looking at the debug_markets.py file which shows `BINANCE_BTC_USDT`

## Remaining Issues
The `parameter_handling_example.py` file still needs to be manually fixed as the edit didn't apply correctly. The line:
```python
market_tag = f"{account.exchange_code}_{market.primary}_{market.secondary}_"
```
Should be:
```python
market_tag = f"{account.exchange_code.upper()}_{market.primary.upper()}_{market.secondary.upper()}_"
```
