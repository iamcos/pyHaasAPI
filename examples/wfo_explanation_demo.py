WFO vs Basic Analysis - Explanation Demo
========================================

This script demonstrates the key differences between:
1. Basic backtest analysis (like your previous financial_analytics.py)
2. Advanced Walk Forward Optimization (WFO) analysis (this new system)

Run this to understand why WFO provides superior strategy evaluation.

üìà TWO TRADING STRATEGIES - SAME PROFIT, DIFFERENT STABILITY:

Strategy A (Flash Crash Trader):
‚Ä¢ Total Profit: +$10,000 (50% ROI)
‚Ä¢ Performance: One massive winning trade of $10,000
‚Ä¢ Time Period: Single day during market crash
‚Ä¢ Risk: Extremely high, unlikely to repeat

Strategy B (Consistent Scalper):
‚Ä¢ Total Profit: +$9,000 (45% ROI)
‚Ä¢ Performance: 100 small wins averaging $90 each
‚Ä¢ Time Period: Consistent performance over 6 months
‚Ä¢ Risk: Low, reliable, repeatable

üèÜ ANALYSIS RESULTS:
Basic Analysis: "Strategy A is better! 50% vs 45% ROI"
WFO Analysis: "Strategy B is better! Stable, consistent, robust"

üí° WHY WFO MATTERS:
‚Ä¢ Strategy A: Lucky one-time event (curve fitting risk)
‚Ä¢ Strategy B: Reliable, repeatable, live-trading ready
‚Ä¢ WFO identifies which strategy will work going FORWARD
