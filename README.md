# Haaslib: A Python Library for Interacting with the HaasOnline API

Haaslib is a Python library designed to simplify interaction with the HaasOnline API.  It provides a robust and efficient way to manage labs, bots, scripts, and other resources within the HaasOnline ecosystem.

## Key Features

* **Simplified API Interaction:**  Haaslib abstracts away the complexities of the HaasOnline API, providing a clean and intuitive Pythonic interface.
* **Robust Error Handling:**  The library incorporates comprehensive error handling, including custom exceptions for common API errors and detailed logging for debugging.
* **Type Safety:**  Leveraging Pydantic models, Haaslib ensures type safety for all API requests and responses, reducing the risk of runtime errors.
* **Efficient Resource Management:**  The library includes tools for efficient management of resources, including labs, bots, and scripts, with built-in mechanisms for cleanup and resource tracking.
* **Comprehensive Testing:**  Haaslib is thoroughly tested to ensure reliability and stability.  Testing guidelines emphasize successful authentication paths, efficient resource management, and robust error handling.

## Usage

This library is designed to be used with Python 3.

### Installation

Since Haaslib is not yet on PyPI, you need to install it from source.  You can clone the repository and install it using pip:

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Navigate to the directory:** `cd haaslib`
3. **Install using pip:** `pip install .`


### Configuration

Before using Haaslib, you need to configure your environment variables with your HaasOnline API credentials.  These typically include:

* `HAAS_API_KEY`: Your HaasOnline API key.
* `HAAS_API_SECRET`: Your HaasOnline API secret.
* `HAAS_API_URL`: The base URL for the HaasOnline API.

You can set these variables in your shell's environment or in a `.env` file.

### Basic Usage Example (Illustrative)

This is a simplified example to illustrate the basic usage.  Refer to the detailed documentation and examples for more comprehensive usage scenarios.

```python
from haaslib import HaasClient

# Initialize the client
client = HaasClient()

# Authenticate (this will use your environment variables)
client.authenticate()

# Perform API calls (replace with actual API calls)
try:
    response = client.get_user_labs()
    print(response)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

```

## API Interaction Guidelines

* **Authentication:**  Secure authentication is handled through environment variables to protect sensitive credentials.
* **Channel Names:**  Use the official channel names from the HaasOnline API documentation.
* **Error Handling:**  Always check the API response success flag and handle errors appropriately.  Haaslib provides custom exceptions to help with this.
* **Rate Limiting:**  Be mindful of API rate limits (e.g., 60 requests per minute). Implement exponential backoff if necessary.

## Project Structure

The project is structured to promote maintainability and scalability.  Key components include:

* `haaslib/`: Contains the core library code.
* `examples/`: Provides example scripts demonstrating the library's usage.  These are a great starting point for learning how to use the library.
* `docs/`: Contains documentation for the library.
* `tests/`: Contains unit and integration tests.
