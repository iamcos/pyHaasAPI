# Haaslib: A Python Library for Interacting with the HaasOnline API

Haaslib is a Python library designed to simplify interaction with the HaasOnline API.  It provides a robust and efficient way to manage labs, bots, scripts, and other resources within the HaasOnline ecosystem.

## Key Features

* **Simplified API Interaction:** Haaslib abstracts away the complexities of the HaasOnline API, providing a clean and intuitive Pythonic interface.
* **Robust Error Handling:** The library incorporates comprehensive error handling, including custom exceptions for common API errors and detailed logging for debugging.
* **Type Safety:** Leveraging Pydantic models, Haaslib ensures type safety for all API requests and responses, reducing the risk of runtime errors.
* **Efficient Resource Management:** The library provides efficient methods for managing labs, bots, and other resources, with automatic cleanup and resource optimization.
* **Comprehensive Trading Operations:** Full support for bot control (activate, deactivate, pause, resume), order management, and real-time market data.
* **Complete Account Management:** Monitor balances, positions, orders, and trade history across all accounts.
* **Advanced Lab Management:** Create, configure, and execute backtests with parameter optimization and detailed results analysis.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install pyHaasAPI
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from pyHaasAPI import api

# Initialize and authenticate
executor = api.RequestsExecutor(
    host="your-haasonline-server.com",
    port=8090,
    state=api.Guest()
).authenticate(email="your-email", password="your-password")

# Get all markets
markets = api.get_all_markets(executor)

# Get account information
accounts = api.get_accounts(executor)

# Create a lab for backtesting
lab = api.create_lab(executor, CreateLabRequest(...))

# Start lab execution
api.start_lab_execution(executor, StartLabExecutionRequest(...))

# Get lab results
results = api.get_backtest_result(executor, GetBacktestResultRequest(...))

# Create a bot from lab results
bot = api.add_bot_from_lab(executor, AddBotFromLabRequest(...))

# Control bot trading
api.activate_bot(executor, bot.bot_id)  # Start trading
api.pause_bot(executor, bot.bot_id)     # Pause trading
api.resume_bot(executor, bot.bot_id)    # Resume trading
api.deactivate_bot(executor, bot.bot_id) # Stop trading

# Monitor orders and positions
orders = api.get_bot_orders(executor, bot.bot_id)
positions = api.get_bot_positions(executor, bot.bot_id)

# Get market data
price = api.get_market_price(executor, "BINANCE_BTC_USDT")
order_book = api.get_order_book(executor, "BINANCE_BTC_USDT", depth=20)
trades = api.get_last_trades(executor, "BINANCE_BTC_USDT", limit=100)

# Monitor account status
balance = api.get_account_balance(executor, account.account_id)
account_orders = api.get_account_orders(executor, account.account_id)
account_positions = api.get_account_positions(executor, account.account_id)
```

## API Discovery & Reverse Engineering

This library was developed through reverse engineering of the HaasOnline API. Our discovery process included:

### üîç **Reverse Engineering Methodology**
- **API Endpoint Mapping**: Identified and documented 108+ API endpoints across 6 main categories
- **Request/Response Analysis**: Mapped field aliases and response structures using Pydantic models
- **Authentication Flow**: Implemented two-step authentication (credentials + one-time code)
- **Parameter Management**: Discovered complex parameter system with type validation and range constraints

### üìä **Current Implementation Status**
- **‚úÖ 42 endpoints implemented** (39% coverage)
- **üîÑ 3 areas partially implemented**
- **‚ùå 66 endpoints remaining** (61% to implement)

### üéØ **Key Discoveries**
- **Bot Control System**: Complete lifecycle management (create, activate, pause, resume, deactivate)
- **Order Management**: Real-time order tracking and cancellation capabilities
- **Account Monitoring**: Comprehensive balance, position, and trade history access
- **Market Data**: Real-time price feeds, order books, and trade data
- **Lab Optimization**: Advanced backtesting with parameter optimization and result analysis
- **Lab Cloning**: Duplicate successful configurations with all parameters preserved
- **Script Management**: Complete script lifecycle (upload, edit, delete, publish, search)
- **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed backtest runtime data, charts, and execution logs

### üß™ **Testing & Validation**
- **Reference Implementation**: `examples/lab_parameters.py` serves as comprehensive test suite
- **API Coverage**: Documented in `API_STATUS.md` with detailed implementation tracking
- **Error Handling**: Robust exception management with detailed logging
- **Type Safety**: Full Pydantic model validation for all API interactions

### üìà **Development Phases**
1. **‚úÖ Phase 1 Complete**: Core trading operations (bot control, order management, market data)
2. **‚úÖ Phase 2 Complete**: Advanced lab features (cloning, analytics, script management)
3. **üîÑ Phase 3 In Progress**: Advanced features (white label, templates, analytics)
