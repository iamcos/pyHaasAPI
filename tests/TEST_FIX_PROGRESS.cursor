## What to Check for Each Script
- [ ] Uses `from config import settings` for all credentials and host/port
- [ ] Loads `.env` if needed
- [ ] Uses recommended authentication pattern
- [ ] Has a main block for direct execution
- [ ] Uses relative imports for local helpers
- [ ] Script runs successfully with `PYTHONPATH=.` from project root
- [ ] Any test-specific logic or output is preserved

## Instructions for Contributors
- Update this file as you patch/verify each script.
- Mark scripts as `[x]` completed, `[ ]` pending, or `[~]` in_progress.
- Add notes for any issues, skipped scripts, or special cases.
- If you add new test scripts, add them to this checklist.
- Refer to `RUNNING_TESTS.cursor` for the standard pattern and troubleshooting.
