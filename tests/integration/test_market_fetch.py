Integration test for market fetching methods using pyHaasAPI.

This test authenticates using credentials from .env and checks:
- Market fetching for multiple exchanges (BINANCE, COINBASE, KRAKEN)
- That target pairs (BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, SOL/USDT) are present in the results
- Prints sample markets for each exchange
