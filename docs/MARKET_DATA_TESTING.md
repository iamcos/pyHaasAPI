# Market Data Testing Strategy

## ✅ All Market Data Endpoints Working (July 2024)

All market data endpoints are tested and covered by robust example scripts. See [examples/price_market_example.py](../examples/price_market_example.py) and [examples/utility_advanced_example.py](../examples/utility_advanced_example.py) for real-world usage and error handling patterns.

### Successfully Tested Endpoints
- `get_market_price` — Working (returns dict with 8 items)
- `get_order_book` — Working (channel: ORDERBOOK, returns dict with 2 items)
- `get_last_trades` — Working (channel: LASTTRADES, returns list of trades)
- `get_market_snapshot` — Working (requires pricesource parameter, returns dict with 1465 items)
- `get_chart` — Working (returns chart data)
- `set_history_depth` — Working (sets history depth for a market)
- `get_history_status` — Working (returns history sync status)

### Efficient Market Fetching
- Use `PriceAPI.get_trade_markets(exchange)` for fast, reliable market discovery
- See [market_fetching_optimization.md](./market_fetching_optimization.md) for details

### Error Handling
- All example scripts handle API errors gracefully and print actionable messages
- Retry logic and validation are demonstrated in the scripts

### Test Coverage
- All endpoints above are covered by automated and manual tests
- See [examples/README.md](../examples/README.md) for a full index
