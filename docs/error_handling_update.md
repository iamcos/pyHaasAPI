# Error Handling Documentation

**Last updated: July 2024**

## Overview

Robust error handling is essential for reliable automation and user experience. All example scripts in the examples/ directory demonstrate best practices for handling API errors, user feedback, and automation.

---

## Best Practices

- Use try/except blocks around all API calls
- Catch `HaasApiError` and print actionable, user-friendly messages
- Validate all input parameters before making API calls
- Print clear instructions if a workflow cannot proceed (e.g., missing account, invalid driver code)
- Log errors for debugging in production/CI environments

---

## Example Patterns

```python
try:
    result = api.add_bot(executor, ...)
except HaasApiError as e:
    print(f"API error: {e}")
    # Optionally: log error, retry, or exit gracefully
```

- See [examples/README.md](../examples/README.md) for real-world error handling patterns

---

## Automation & CI/CD

- Use environment variables or config files for credentials and configuration
- Avoid interactive prompts in automated scripts
- Print actionable error messages for CI logs

---

## Notes
- All examples and API functions are up to date as of July 2024
