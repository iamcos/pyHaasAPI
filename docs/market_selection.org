* Overview

Selecting the right market is essential for strategy execution and backtesting.

* Market Retrieval

Retrieve all available markets from the API.

#+begin_src python
from pyHaasAPI.price import PriceAPI

price_api = PriceAPI(auth_executor)
markets = price_api.get_all_markets()
for market in markets:
    print(f"Market: {market.primary}/{market.secondary}")
#+end_src

* Market Validation

Ensure the selected market is valid for the account and strategy.

#+begin_src python
valid_market = price_api.get_valid_market(account.exchange_code)
if price_api.validate_market(valid_market):
    print(f"Valid market: {valid_market.primary}/{valid_market.secondary}")
#+end_src

* Best Practices

1. Validate market data availability
2. Check market compatibility with account
