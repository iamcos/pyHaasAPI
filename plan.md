## Development Plan: pyHaasAPI FastAPI Wrapper (`mcp_server`)

### Current Status

Development is focused on exposing `pyHaasAPI` functionalities through the `mcp_server` FastAPI application.

**Implemented & Tested Endpoints:**

*   **Account Management:** `/get_accounts`, `/get_account_data/{account_id}`, `/get_account_balance`, `/get_all_account_balances`.
*   **Market Data:** `/get_all_markets`, `/get_market_price`, `/get_orderbook`.
*   **Lab Management:** `/create_lab`, `/delete_lab`, `/clone_lab`, `/get_lab_config`, `/update_lab_config`.
*   **Bot Management:** `/create_trade_bot_from_lab` (using `api.add_bot` as a workaround due to `add_bot_from_lab` issues), `/activate_bot/{bot_id}`, `/deactivate_bot/{bot_id}`, `/get_all_trade_bots`, `/delete_trade_bot/{bot_id}`.
*   **Backtesting:** `/backtest_lab`, `/get_backtest_results`.
*   **Performance Monitoring:** `/get_bot_logbook/{bot_id}`, `/get_all_completed_orders`.
*   **Script Execution Status:** `/is_script_execution/{script_id}` (Newly added).

**Key Debugging & Refinements:**

*   **Standardized FastAPI Responses:** All `mcp_server` FastAPI endpoints have been modified to consistently return data wrapped in the `ApiResponse` structure (`{"Success": True, "Error": "", "Data": actual_data}`). This ensures predictable and consistent API responses.
*   **Ongoing Test Alignment:** Actively working on updating `tools/mcp_server/tests/test_mcp_api.py` to correctly interpret and assert against the new `ApiResponse` structure. This includes addressing `KeyError: 'Data'` and `TypeError` issues by adjusting data access within the tests (e.g., `response.json()["Data"]`).
*   **Enhanced Error Logging:** Detailed logging with tracebacks added to `mcp_server/main.py` and `pyHaasAPI/api.py` for better diagnostics.
*   **Robust `get_bot_runtime`:** Implemented retry mechanism in `pyHaasAPI/api.py` for `get_bot_runtime` to handle API data availability delays.
*   **`HaasBot.settings` Initialization:** Ensured `HaasBot.settings` is reliably initialized in `pyHaasAPI/model.py` to prevent `AttributeError`.

### Architecture Overview

*   **`pyHaasAPI`:** The core Python library responsible for direct interaction with the HaasOnline API.
*   **`mcp_server` (FastAPI):** A Python FastAPI application located in the `tools/mcp_server` directory. It acts as a wrapper, exposing selected `pyHaasAPI` functions as RESTful API endpoints. This server is designed to be consumed by other services, such as the `haasscript_mcp_local_server` (Node.js/TypeScript) for functionalities like text embeddings.
*   **HaasOnline API Credentials:** Configured via environment variables in the project's root `.env` file.
*   **Testing:** Integration tests are written using `pytest` and `TestClient` to simulate HTTP requests to the FastAPI application. Tests now dynamically create and clean up test data on a live HaasOnline Trade Server.

### Development Environment and Debugging

*   **Virtual Environment (`.venv`):** The project utilizes a Python virtual environment (`.venv`) to manage dependencies and ensure a consistent development environment. All project dependencies are installed within this isolated environment.
*   **FastAPI Auto-Reload:** The FastAPI server is configured with auto-reload, meaning that any changes saved to the Python source files will automatically trigger a server restart, allowing for rapid development and debugging without manual intervention.
*   **Debugging Methods:**
    *   **Print Statements:** Used for quick inspection of variable values and execution flow.
    *   **Logging:** Structured logging with different levels (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR) is implemented to provide detailed insights into application behavior and errors.
    *   **IDE Debuggers:** Integration with IDE debuggers (e.g., VS Code debugger) is supported for setting breakpoints, stepping through code, and inspecting the call stack.

### Remaining Tasks & Known Issues

1.  **`edit_bot_parameter` (Bot Script Parameter Editing):**
    *   **Status:** It has been confirmed through `curl` commands that the `EDIT_SETTINGS` channel *is* supported by the HaasOnline API for modifying bot parameters, including `scriptParameters`. My previous conclusion that `EDIT_BOT` was unsupported was a misunderstanding of the correct API channel. The `get_bot_script_parameters` function has been successfully implemented in `pyHaasAPI/api.py` to retrieve bot script parameters from `get_bot_runtime`.
    *   **Next Steps:**
        *   **Re-implement `edit_bot_parameter`:** Implement a function in `pyHaasAPI/api.py` that utilizes the `EDIT_SETTINGS` channel to update bot parameters. This function will need to correctly format the `settings` JSON payload as demonstrated in the provided `curl` command.
        *   **Update `mcp_server`:** Create a new endpoint in `mcp_server/main.py` to expose this `edit_bot_parameter` functionality.
        *   **Create a new test script for `edit_bot_parameter`:** Develop a comprehensive test to verify the functionality of the new editing function, including fetching parameters, modifying them, and verifying the changes.
2.  **`test_get_bot_logbook` Functionality:**
    *   **Status:** This test currently uses a placeholder `bot_id` and fails.
    *   **Next Steps:** Implement logic within the test to dynamically create a bot, activate it, allow it to generate some log data (if possible within a reasonable timeframe), and then retrieve and assert against its logs. This will ensure the test is fully functional and reflects real-world usage.
3.  **Comprehensive Testing for Remaining Endpoints:** Continue implementing and refining tests for all endpoints, especially focusing on edge cases and error handling.

### Challenges and Notes

*   **Live HaasOnline Trade Server:** Tests are now running against a live HaasOnline Trade Server, dynamically creating and deleting entities. This requires careful management of test data and server state.
*   **Pydantic Model Compatibility:** Ensuring correct data serialization and deserialization between FastAPI and `pyHaasAPI`'s Pydantic models remains a challenge, requiring careful alignment of field aliases and data types.
*   **HaasOnline API Limitations:** Certain functionalities, like direct editing of bot script parameters, appear to be limited or unsupported by the underlying HaasOnline API channels, necessitating workarounds or alternative approaches.
